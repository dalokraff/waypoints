description = "[h1]This an updated version of [url=https://github.com/badwin-vt/waypoints]Badwin's Waypoint mod[/url][/h1]
Aside from making the mod compatible with the current version of the game, I added in new career specifc waypoint icons from a [url=https://github.com/danreeves/vermintide-2-mods/tree/master/MMONames2/textures/mods/MMONames2]texture atlas provided by raindish[/url]

Allows players to set waypoints in the world with a custom keybind (check Mod Options in the main menu). Useful for coordinating positioning or telling the dozy Kruber where to go.

[b]Note: teammates must have this mod to see waypoints.[/b]
